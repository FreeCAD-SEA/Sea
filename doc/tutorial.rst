Creating an SEA model
*********************
In FreeCAD-SEA an SEA model can be made by taking the following steps:

* Create a geometry in the Part workbench.
* Merge the geometry into a single Fusion using Usion.
* Switch to the SEA workbench
* Add an SEA system and optionally build the system from the geometry.




Examples

The following code shows how such a model can be created.
