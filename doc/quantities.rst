The following is a list of all physical quantities relevant to SEA.

.. _quantities_general:

General quantities
==================

.. glossary::

    frequency
        Frequency `f` is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time and has the unit hertz (Hz).
          
    
    angular frequency
        Angular frequency :math:`\omega` is the frequency of an oscillation in unit radians per second (rad/s).

        .. math::

            \omega = 2 \pi f
            
    speed of sound
        Speed of sound `c` describes the speed at which a wave passes through a medium.

            Phase speed :math:`c_{phase}`

            Group speed :math:`c_{group}` 


    aera moment of inertia
    second moment of inertia
        Area moment of area, also known as 'second moment of inertia, 'moment of inertia of plane area, or 'second area moment', 
        is a geometrical property of an area which reflects how its points are distributed with regards to an arbitrary axis.
        It has unit (m^4).


.. _quantities_energy:

Energy quantities
==================

.. glossary::

    velocity
        The velocity `v`


    velocity level
        The velocity level `L_v` 


    mobility
        The mobility `Y`
            

    mnergy
        The energy `E`

        
.. _quantities_modal:

Modal quantities
================

.. glossary::

    mode count
        The mode count `N` is the estimation of the amount of modes in a frequency band.


    modal density    
        The modal density `n` is obtained by differentiating the mode count `N` with respect to the angular frequency `\omega`.

        .. math::
            
            n = \frac{dN}{d \omega}



    modal overlap
        The modal overlap `M`
   

    modal energy
        The modal energy `e`
   
    density
        The density :math:`\rho`


.. _quantities_material:

Material quantities
===================
        
.. glossary::

    young's modulus
        Young's modulus `E`, also known as the tensile modulus or elastic modulus, 
        is a measure of the stiffness of an elastic material, and has the unit pascal (Pa).


    bending stiffness
        Bending stiffness `B`


    shear modulus
        Shear modulus `G` or modulus of rigidity, is defined as the ratio of shear stress to the shear strain, and has the unit pascal (Pa).


    bulk modulus
        Bulk modulus `K` of a substance measures the substance's resistance to uniform compression. 
        It is defined as the ratio of the infinitesimal pressure increase to the resulting relative decrease 
        of the volume, and has the unit pascal (Pa).


    poisson's ratio
        Poisson's ratio :math:`\nu` is the negative ratio of transverse to axial strain. Poisson's ratio is dimensionless.

    loss factor 
    .. _lossfactor:
        Loss factor :math:`\eta` describes the amount of energy lost per cycle.
