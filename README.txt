Introduction
============

Statistical Energy Analysis is a method for predicting the flow of vibrational
power through a structure. SEA is used within vibroacoustics to model the flow
of acoustic power through a vibrating system. An example is modeling the
vibrations in cars due to the engine. SEA is generally used in the
high-frequency region whereas finite-element analysis is used in the
low-frequency region.

FreeCAD-SEA
===========
FreeCAD-SEA extends FreeCAD with SEA capabilities. This module provides classes
and functions to perform an Statistical Energy Analysis. SEA models can be
created graphically, via the Python console or by writing Python scripts.
